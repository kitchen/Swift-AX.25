# AX.25

This library aims to implement as complete an [AX.25](https://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html) stack as possible in Swift.

The eventual goal is to combine it with my [KissTNC](https://github.com/kitchen/KissTNC) library and have a complete KISS+AX.25 stack for writing packet software for iOS and macOS using Swift.
